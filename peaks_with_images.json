    "description":"K2, the world's second highest mountain, richly deserves the place it has earned in the public's imagination as an equal to Everest in the mountain pantheon.  The question of what is the hardest mountain in the world to climb will never be objectively determined, but K2 offers as compelling a case as any peak for the honor: extreme altitude, massive scale, steep slopes on all sides, unstable weather, killer avalanches, remoteness from roadheads, and a location in a politically unstable region near a war zone. K2 lords over the Karakoram Range on the border of Pakistan and China, and is not located in the Himalaya (although calling the Karakoram part of a vague \"Greater Himalaya\" region would not be totally inaccurate).  It is a massive pyramid, without the major sub-peaks, shoulders, or buttressing ridges common on the Himalayan peaks like Everest.  To climb K2, you must really climb it, from the base, and there are no shortcuts. The peak's name is an old survey designation from the 1800s, when the peaks in the Karakoram range were numbered K1, K2, K3, etc. by early surveyors.  Appropriate local names were found for other peaks, but K2's isolation left it without one.  Altenate names have been put forward over the years, both pseudo-local (Dapsang, Chogori) and European (Mount Godwin-Austen), but by now the simple, stark, two-character code is not only universally accepted, but is even seen by some as somehow fitting for this simple, stark, and majestic peak.",

    "description":"Aconcagua is the highest mountain in South America, in the western hemisphere, and in the southern hemisphere, too.  No other peak on earth, except Mount Everest, is further away from a higher peak--you have to travel over 10,250 miles to the Hindu Kush Mountains of Pakistan to find higher ground when traveling from Aconcagua. There have been occasional noises made by the Argentines and others that \r\nAconcagua might be over 7000m high, but it seems that the consensus is that it falls just short, leaving all the world's 7000m peaks in central Asia.  An Italian expedition in 2001 with super-accurate GPS equipment has fixed the peak's elevation at 6961.83 meters. The mountain is geologically complex, and while many of the rocks that form it are volcanic, the general feeling seems to be that Aconcagua is not an eroded, long-dormant volcano, as one might suppose.  That leaves Ojos del Salado, in the Puna de Atacama well north of Aconcagua, as the world's highest volcano. The peak is located 15 km east of the main crest of the Andes, entirely in Argentina.  This is the dry side of the Andes, so, despite its height, Aconcagua is not particularly icy or snowy.  The standard routes up the mountain involve no glacier travel.  The area is not as arid as the bone-dry Puna de Atacama, but the glaciation is less than in the Andean peaks of Peru and Patagonia. Climbing Notes: With a city of 4 million (Santiago, Chile) 100 kilometers away, and with the major trans-Andean highway from Santiago to Mendoza, Argentina passing just south of the peak, access is easy to Aconcagua.  The standard route is just a long hike, and by far the greatest difficulty is the high elevation.  Altitude sickness kills unacclimatized climbers on this mountain, so it is important to go up slowly.  The other main danger is storms--Aconcagua is exceptionally windy, and one must be prepared to wait out bad weather. Two weeks is the recommended minimum time it would take to fly there from the USA and do the hike, and three would be better.  Aconcagua makes an attractive destination: there is no easier way to climb to 6900m in the world, nor is there an easier peak with more prominence or isolation.

    "description":"Denali is the highest mountain in North America and perhaps the single most impressive mountain in the world--all higher peaks are in the greater Himalaya or in the Andes, part of enormous mountain ranges.  Denali rises almost alone, 16,000 feet above the snowline, with only nearby Mount Foraker even close to it in height.  Although part of the Alaska Range, a massive ice-clad range of spectacular peaks, Denali so utterly dominates its area that what would otherwise be major ice peaks sometimes seem like mere foothills. Denali is also perhaps the coldest mountain in the world outside of Antarctica--its combination of great height, high latitude, and terrible weather are literally unique.  The summit area is below zero degrees Fahrenheit almost all of the time, and ferocious wind lashes the peak virtually incessantly. Although considered a technically easy climb by the most popular routes, an ascent of Denali is a serious undertaking made difficult by the cold, the weather, and the sheer scale of the massive mountain.  On average during the past few years, about 1000 climbers attempt the summit per season, 500 make it, and 3 die.  The climbing season runs from mid-April until mid-July, since before then it is too cold, and after that too stormy and the snow too mushy and unstable from too much sun.  Theoretically, early season (May) is colder but less stormy, and later (June) is warmer with more snowfall, but in a given year anything can happen.  Success percentages for a year have gone as low as 31% (1987) or as high as 67% (1983). The standard route is the technically easy West Buttress, which starts at a glacier airplane runway at 7200'--virtually everyone flies on to the glacier to avoid an arduous approach.  The standard rule is to allow three weeks for the climb, and to be prepared to spend a week of that holed up in your tent waiting for the weather to clear.  Other routes include: the Muldrow Glacier route, technically easy but involving a long approach over the tundra from the north; the West Rib, a more challenging climb involving a steep couloir; and the Cassin Ridge, a committing and difficult rock climb. On August 30, 2015, the US Department of the Interior, with the support of the US president, changed the official name of the mountain to \"Denali\" from \"Mount McKinley\".  This change ratifies the name that has long been used by many in the mountain climbing community, as wells as by the Alaskan Natives. To many it had long seemed a more fitting name than one memorializing the obscure 25th U.S. president, William McKinley.  The U.S. Congress changed the name of the surrounding park to Denali National Park in 1980, but congressmen from Ohio (McKinley's home state) blocked the name change for the mountain itself for many years.  Although the peak was named by a partisan prospector before McKinley was even elected president, his subsequent 1901 assassination helped make the name stick. Perhaps the best justification for naming the peak after McKinley was that he selected Theodore Roosevelt as his vice-president, and therefore his assassination put the first environment-minded president into office.",

No other mountain in the world rises so high so alone, with no range of other peaks for support.

Traditionally, Elbrus is considered the highest mountain in Europe, since \r\nthe Asia-Europe boundary follows the crest of the Caucasus, south of the peak.  It is a long way from areas generally considered \"European\", but as a continent Europe does not make much geographical sense anyway.  On this web site, all of the Caucasus is considered part of Europe. Elbrus is one of the famous Seven Summits continental high points.  And, now that the Central Asian Republics are no longer part of the Soviet Union, it is the highest peak in Russia, the largest country on earth.

    "description":"The highest point in all Antarctica is Vinson Massif, now famous as one of the \"Seven Summits\".  Sometimes referred to as \"Mount Vinson\", it is named after a U.S. congressman from Georgia who was friendly towards the Antrarctic reseach programs during the International Geophysical Year of 1957, when the peak was discovered and mapped. Mountain guide companies run trips to this frozen, isolated peak in the West Antarctica interior every year, charging clients tens of thousands of dollars per person.  The climbing is reportedly easy, ignoring the bitter cold and ridiculous logistics of getting yourself there.  The usual method is to use a cargo plane with ski landing gear, leaving from southern Chile.  Only a cargo plane has the necessary range for the flight, and basecamp is set up on the smooth ice cap to the west of the Sentinel Range. Info from Mike Sharp at Antarctic Logistics and  Expeditions Llc: We now run an almost \r\nweekly scheduled flight to Patriot Hills Antarctica using an IL-76 jet, which is a cargo \r\nplane designed and built for landing on gravel strips in Siberia. It is ideal for \r\nthe job and lands on our ice runway on wheels. Passengers are then transferred to \r\nVinson Massif by ski equipped Twin Otter. The climb is of similar difficulty to Denali \r\nWest Buttress, but several days shorter--most parties take about 14 days round trip from Punta Arenas, Chile.",

    "description":"The highest peak between the Andes and the Himalaya is Carstensz Pyramid (or Puncak Jaya), rising to almost 5000 meters on the tropical island of New Guinea.  It is also the highest mountain on an island on the planet, and perhaps the strongest candidate for highest point of the Australia\/Oceania continent. Europeans have long called this peak the Carstensz Pyramid, or Mount Carstensz, after the Dutch navigator who first sighted it on a rare clear day.  The Netherlands held on to western New Guinea longer than the rest of Indonesia, turning the area over in 1960.  The Indonesians then renamed the peak Puncak Jaya, or \"Mount Victory\", once they gained control of the area.  But most English-speaking mountaineers still call the peak Carstensz, and that name is most often used by the increasing hordes of seven-summit devotees. Carstensz is high and wet enough to support some small glaciers, only 4 degrees from the equator.  Surrounded by unexplored rainforest, the area is difficult to reach for the casual tourist.  Recent guerilla activity by the OPM rebel group, seeking West Papua's independence from Indonesia, has made the situation more difficult.  There is a large copper mine just 8 kilometers west of the summit at Tembagapura. This operation is owned by a U.S. corporation and it has become a flashpoint in the struggle, with the natives maintaining that the mine is polluting and imperialist.  Neither the OPM or the miners are very friendly to climbers, and access remains difficult. Still, as one of the dominant peaks of the world and generally considered one of the \"Seven Summits\", Carstensz is still climbed by intrepid westerners, mostly on pre-arranged adventure-travel tours.  The rich culture of the isolated tribes of the central New Guinea highlands is an added attraction to any journey into the area.",

    "description":"If the Caucasus is not held to be \"European\", then Mont Blanc is the highest point in Europe.  Arguments rage back and forth over whether Mont Blanc or Elbrus in far southern Russia deserves this title, but, given a  strict definition of the Asia-Europe boundary as the crest of the Caucasus, Elbrus is the king and therefore one of the famous \"Seven Summits\". Blanc, however, has more isolation (distance to a higher peak) than Elbrus, and it is clearly the dominant summit of the large western peninsula of the Eurasian landmass.  By any measure the monarch of the Alps is one of the world's premier summits. A massive dome of snow, Blanc is one of the many instances in the world of the highest point in a range being one of the easier major summits to climb.  The sheer size of Mont Blanc makes its summit area a broad, gentle crest, and routes from the French side are generally easier than the massive, jumbled face rising from the Italian half of the mountain. Location: French maps show the France-Italy border following the watershed line in the Mont Blanc Massif, except for a curious jog to the south that fully encloses the immediate summit area of Mont Blanc as totally in France.  Italian maps show the boundary following the watershed line in full, with the summit on the border of the two nations.  This is curious state of affairs, and it is not 100% clear which country is sovereign in a small patch of snow at the very apex of the Alps. This web site takes the Italian view, and lists Mont Blanc as the highest point in both France and Italy.  The reasons are: huge precedent for boundaries following watersheds around the world; nothing significant is lost to France by sharing the peak, while the Italians gain a real national high point; and no historic document or treaty can be found to support the unusual jog in the border. Climbing Notes: The standard and easiest route begins at the end of the Mont Blanc Tramway, a cog railway leading from Le Fayet and St. Gervais-les-Bains up to Nid d'Aigle at 2372m.  From there a hiking path leads to the vicinity of the Tete Rousse hut at 3167m, and then the route reaches the most difficult section, the long ascent of the crumbling rock of the steep northwest face of the Aiguille du Gouter.  Steel cables make technical rock-climbing gear \r\nunecessary, but rockfall down a gully that has to be crossed can be dangerous. At the top of this steep face lies the Gouter hut at 3817m, and from there the route follows a long, snowy, undulating ridgecrest over several minor bumps, the net effect always up, to the summit.  Crevasses are rarely present on this ridge walk, and if the weather is good the only problems are the incredible crowds of climbers and the increasingly thin air.  A careful and confident climber should have no trouble soloing this peak. It's best to hike to the Gouter Hut the first day, and then get an early start the next morning for the summit.  On my climb I stayed at the lower Tete Rousse hut, figuring it would be less crowded, but I had to start up at 1 AM and face the crumbling rock face in the pitch blackness.  Like most huts in the Alps, both the Tete Rousse and Gouter huts can get very crowded, noisy, and unsanitary.  Some people bivouac outside near the huts and get away with it, despite the technical illegality of the practice. There are other routes on Mont Blanc, of course.  A long climb can be made directly from Chamonix via the Grand Mulets hut, but the larger vertical gain and nasty crevasse problems make this route much more serious than the Gouter route.  Intrepid climbers also start at the top of the Aiguille du Midi cable car and climb Mont Blanc de Tacul and Mont Maudit on the way to Mont Blanc in one very long day.

From there a hiking path leads to the vicinity of the Tete Rousse hut at 3167m, and then the route reaches the most difficult section, the long ascent of the crumbling rock of the steep northwest face of the Aiguille du Gouter.  Steel cables make technical rock-climbing gear \r\nunecessary, but rockfall down a gully that has to be crossed can be dangerous. At the top of this steep face lies the Gouter hut at 3817m, and from there the route follows a long, snowy, undulating ridgecrest over several minor bumps, the net effect always up, to the summit.  Crevasses are rarely present on this ridge walk, and if the weather is good the only problems are the incredible crowds of climbers and the increasingly thin air.  A careful and confident climber should have no trouble soloing this peak. It's best to hike to the Gouter Hut the first day, and then get an early start the next morning for the summit.  On my climb I stayed at the lower Tete Rousse hut, figuring it would be less crowded, but I had to start up at 1 AM and face the crumbling rock face in the pitch blackness.  Like most huts in the Alps, both the Tete Rousse and Gouter huts can get very crowded, noisy, and unsanitary.  Some people bivouac outside near the huts and get away with it, despite the technical illegality of the practice. There are other routes on Mont Blanc, of course.  A long climb can be made directly from Chamonix via the Grand Mulets hut, but the larger vertical gain and nasty crevasse problems make this route much more serious than the Gouter route.  Intrepid climbers also start at the top of the Aiguille du Midi cable car and climb Mont Blanc de Tacul and Mont Maudit on the way to Mont Blanc in one very long day. A massive dome of snow, Blanc is one of the many instances in the world of the highest point in a range being one of the easier major summits to climb.  The sheer size of Mont Blanc makes its summit area a broad, gentle crest, and routes from the French side are generally easier than the massive, jumbled face rising from the Italian half of the mountain. Location: French maps show the France-Italy border following the watershed line in the Mont Blanc Massif, except for a curious jog to the south that fully encloses the immediate summit area of Mont Blanc as totally in France.  Italian maps show the boundary following the watershed line in full, with the summit on the border of the two nations.  This is curious state of affairs, and it is not 100% clear which country is sovereign in a small patch of snow at the very apex of the Alps. This web site takes the Italian view, and lists Mont Blanc as the highest point in both France and Italy.

    "description":"Most people, including a good percentage of the tourists that throng \r\nZermatt, do not realize that the Matterhorn is not the highest peak in the Swiss Alps.  That honor belongs to the Dufourspitze, the crowning peak of the Monte Rosa massif, located a few \r\nmiles east of the Matterhorn and rising just over 150 m\/500 feet higher. Other confusing myths swirl around the Dufourspitze.  It is not the highest point in Italy as well as Switzerland, as is sometimes claimed--indeed, the actual summit lies 160m west of the border, entirely on the Swiss side.  This also means that the Dufourspitze is also the highest peak \"entirely within\" Switzerland, an honor sometimes given to the Dom (14,911'\/4545m), high point of the nearby Mischabel range.  To be fair, the Dom is certainly much further inside Switzerland than 160 horizontal meters! Other confusing myths swirl around the Dufourspitze.

    "description":"Often called the highest mountain in Southeast Asia, Kinabalu is one of the great, massive tropical mountains of the world, rising 4000 m\/14,000' out of the humid rainforests of Borneo.  Although technically speaking the Himalayan outliers in northern Myanmar (Burma) are higher and could be considered part of Southeast Asia, Kinabalu is still the dominant summit between the high Central Asian complex and the ranges of New Guinea.  It also makes Borneo the third highest island in the world, trailing only New Guinea and the Big Island of Hawaii. Like other huge isolated peaks, Kinabalu rises through many life zones and habitats.  The base of the main path to the summit starts in cool, dense cloud forest, and the large summit plateau is a fantastic expanse of odd-shaped rocky pinnacles utterly devoid of soil and vegetation.  The highest summit is called Low's peak, an ironic name that comes from an early explorer.  On very rare occasions snow even falls on the bare rock of the summit. Climbing Notes Kinabalu is a very popular climb with an easy trail to the summit.  The greatest obstacles are the altitude and distance, but most fit hikers can do the climb in two days easily.

    "description":"Yushan (Jade Mountain) in Taiwan can be called the highest mountain in East Asia and the Far East. To find higher peaks you have to go west to the Himalayan outliers in Sichuan, north to Kamchatka in Siberia, or south to Borneo. This area where Yushan stands supreme includes Japan, Korea, Taiwan, Indochina, and all of eastern China. Taiwan is not a big tourist destination, and few travelers or mountaineers realize that this small, crowded island features a rugged backbone of high mountains.Yushan is the highest, but there are many other interesting peaks in Taiwan, several of them much harder to climb than Yushan. Taiwan's mountains are not volcanoes, a refreshing change from places like Indonesia or Japan's Fuji. Although high and rocky, Yushan is only a few hundred meters above the timberline and is only snow-covered in winter. Two trails reach the summit, but the surrounding terrain is marked by steep cliffs overlooking deep, forested gorges, and landslides mark the hillsides and often wash out parts of the paths. Climbing Notes There are two routes to the summit. The main trail from the Tataka (Tatajia) trailhead is the most popular and easiest - 2 days round-trip. The other is a 3-day round-trip hike from the hot-spring town of Dongpu (Tungpu). This longer and harder route (23 km and 2800 vertical meters) has been closed since the destruction caused by Typhoon Morakot in August 2009, and it is not expected to reopen for some time.  This is also the best route to Yushan National Park's remoter mountains and the historic Batongguan (Patongkuan) Trail. The Tataka route: The 3km from the public road and checkpoint to the actual traihead (Tataka Anbu, 2,600 meters) is served by a shuttle bus NT$100; 8.5km hiking brings you to Paiyun Cabin; the main summit is another 2.4 km beyond Paiyun. Almost all hikers stay at Paiyun Cabin for one night, leaving for the summit in the pre-dawn, descending to the trailhead mid-afternoon. The trail is clear with bilingual signposts at regular intervals. Take extra care closer to the summit when the path crosses scree and becomes narrower, rougher and more exposed. Fixed chains available in the final scramble approach to the summit. Tataka (Tatajia, Tatachai) is where Highway 18 (110km mark) becomes Highway 21 (145km mark), also known as the New Cross-Island Highway, connecting Chaiyi and Nantou Counties. As well as excellent day hiking in the area, there is also a simple hostel (Upper Dongpu Lodge), visitor center, and police\/warden station. The nearest access to public transport is at Alishan 19 km away. Minibus transport to Tataka can be arranged in Alishan to Tataka, otherwise have your own transport or hitch-hike this very quiet road. Paiyun Cabin (3,400 meters) is a simple structure, barrack-style rooms, no food or bedding is offered unless arranged in advance. A new, and more sophistaced , structure is to be finished in 2011. Reliable water supply, basic padded sleeping platforms, warden on duty. Currently costs 7 $US per night. If arriving at Paiyun with time to spare, consider a trip to the West Peak. Fit and experienced hikers may apply to stay in a higher cabin, Yuanfong, a base camp for Yushan's southern peaks. This is much smaller than Paiyun, more exposed, and can lack water. Permits must be obtained - well in advance. The number of hikers climbing the mountain is limited to the spaces available at Paiyun (and Yuanfong). Weekends are very popular and thus very hard to obtain permits for. The mountain is closed 'to rest' every February. Permits are canceled should there be dangerous amounts of ice\/snow, or a typhoon approaching. Where previously it was feasible to 'wander' in, it is now impossible\/highly inadvisable to hike without a valid permit. You will be turned back and liable to prosecution. Therefore, the main obstacle in arranging a climb of Yushan is the, slowly-improving, permit process. To climb Yushan you need to have both a 'National Park' and 'Mountain Entry' permit. The Mountain Entry ('ru-shan', or 'Police Permit') is relatively easy to obtain on the spot at the Tataka warden station or in advance at certain police stations. The National Park ('ru-yuan'. or Ecological Area) permit is the more difficult to secure. Start planning at least a month in advance, and remember it is only valid for the specific dates and route listed. Application must be made to Yushan National Park ( http:\/\/www.ysnp.gov.tw\/ ). An expat-run group Barking Deer Adventures arrange packages and permit support. Topographical maps can be purchased at http:\/\/www.booksfromtaiwan.com . Note: it is not necessary (legally or in practice) to have a guide, or to be part of a group - ascents by individuals allowed. Novice hikers may benefit from being with others. Single-day ascent permits not being issued anymore without lots of proof of ability and experience. Other than February when no permits are issued it is possible to climb Yushan all year round. Popular times to climb are October\/November and March\/April. Taiwanese find the winter months a bit too cold, summers can have rain or become cloudy by early afternoon. (Thanks to Richard Foster for the detailed climbing information) Trivia On the south ridge of Yu Shan the Tropic of Cancer reaches it's highest elevation on earth.

This is also the best route to Yushan National Park's remoter mountains and the historic Batongguan (Patongkuan) Trail. The Tataka route: The 3km from the public road and checkpoint to the actual traihead (Tataka Anbu, 2,600 meters) is served by a shuttle bus NT$100; 8.5km hiking brings you to Paiyun Cabin; the main summit is another 2.4 km beyond Paiyun. Almost all hikers stay at Paiyun Cabin for one night, leaving for the summit in the pre-dawn, descending to the trailhead mid-afternoon. The trail is clear with bilingual signposts at regular intervals. Take extra care closer to the summit when the path crosses scree and becomes narrower, rougher and more exposed. Fixed chains available in the final scramble approach to the summit. Tataka (Tatajia, Tatachai) is where Highway 18 (110km mark) becomes Highway 21 (145km mark), also known as the New Cross-Island Highway, connecting Chaiyi and Nantou Counties. As well as excellent day hiking in the area, there is also a simple hostel (Upper Dongpu Lodge), visitor center, and police\/warden station. The nearest access to public transport is at Alishan 19 km away. Minibus transport to Tataka can be arranged in Alishan to Tataka, otherwise have your own transport or hitch-hike this very quiet road. Paiyun Cabin (3,400 meters) is a simple structure, barrack-style rooms, no food or bedding is offered unless arranged in advance. A new, and more sophistaced , structure is to be finished in 2011. Reliable water supply, basic padded sleeping platforms, warden on duty. Currently costs 7 $US per night. If arriving at Paiyun with time to spare, consider a trip to the West Peak. Fit and experienced hikers may apply to stay in a higher cabin, Yuanfong, a base camp for Yushan's southern peaks. This is much smaller than Paiyun, more exposed, and can lack water. Permits must be obtained - well in advance. The number of hikers climbing the mountain is limited to the spaces available at Paiyun (and Yuanfong). Weekends are very popular and thus very hard to obtain permits for. The mountain is closed 'to rest' every February. Permits are canceled should there be dangerous amounts of ice\/snow, or a typhoon approaching. Where previously it was feasible to 'wander' in, it is now impossible\/highly inadvisable to hike without a valid permit. You will be turned back and liable to prosecution. Therefore, the main obstacle in arranging a climb of Yushan is the, slowly-improving, permit process. To climb Yushan you need to have both a 'National Park' and 'Mountain Entry' permit. The Mountain Entry ('ru-shan', or 'Police Permit') is relatively easy to obtain on the spot at the Tataka warden station or in advance at certain police stations. The National Park ('ru-yuan'. or Ecological Area) permit is the more difficult to secure. Start planning at least a month in advance, and remember it is only valid for the specific dates and route listed. Application must be made to Yushan National Park ( http:\/\/www.ysnp.gov.tw\/ ). An expat-run group Barking Deer Adventures arrange packages and permit support. Topographical maps can be purchased at http:\/\/www.booksfromtaiwan.com . Note: it is not necessary (legally or in practice) to have a guide, or to be part of a group - ascents by individuals allowed. Novice hikers may benefit from being with others. Single-day ascent permits not being issued anymore without lots of proof of ability and experience. Other than February when no permits are issued it is possible to climb Yushan all year round. Popular times to climb are October\/November and March\/April. Taiwanese find the winter months a bit too cold, summers can have rain or become cloudy by early afternoon.

    "description":"Although its 3754-meter elevation is very low by world standards, make no mistake: Mount Cook is one of the most impressive and daunting mountains in the world, right up there with the peaks of the Himalaya, Peruvian Andes, and the Alaska Range. Several factors combine to make Mount Cook the impressive peak it is.  The weather in the Southern Alps is usually horrible, with massive amounts of snow falling all year round.  This makes for extensive glaciers and snowfields with frequent avalanches, and the alpine terrain near the peak is consequently difficult.  The vertical rise of Mt. Cook is close to 3000 meters on either side of its range, making for a long and tiring approach from the lowlands unless a plane is used.  Finally, the summit itself is a very steep knife edge that is what remains after the top 10 meters of the summit fell away in a massive landslide\/avalanche on December 14th, 1991. Mount Cook has three summits, all close together along the north-south trending summit ridge, with the north one (High Peak) the highest--the middle peak (3717m) and south (Low) peak (3593m) are slightly lower.  Edmund Hillary made a notable first ascent on Mount Cook in his pre-Everest days.  Surrounding Mount Cook on almost all sides are scores of other impressive icy giants, such as Mount Tasman, second highest mountain in New Zealand, and Mount Sefton, constantly avalanching snow down it's tremendous southeast face. As noted above, Mount Cook is one of the most difficult mountains to climb in the world, a suitable goal for only the most experienced and skilled mountaineers.  The usual practice is to get a small plane ride to the Plateau Hut at 2200 meters, then wait there for a window of good weather, which often will not come before you run out of food.  The summit climb features a lot of very steep snow and ice, culminating in the airy knife-edge of the actual summit. As mentioned in my journal entry , during my visit to New Zealand in 1993 I discovered that guides charged US $1,400.00 to take one climber to the summit, with the guide\/client ratio inflexible at 1:1 and no guarantees with regards to the horrible weather.  In 2004 an experienced American climber told me that guides will not take you up Mount Cook unless they have climbed with you a great deal in the past.  The best bet is to team up with a friend (two-man teams seem to be the standard on this peak), make sure you both know what you are doing, and go for it yourselves.  Good luck!",

    "description":"Triglav is the highest mountain in what used to be Yugoslavia.  Now it crowns the new country of Slovenia, the most stable, western-oriented, and peaceful of the former Yugoslav republics.  It lies only 15 miles from the Austrian and Italian borders, crowning the Julian Alps subrange. Triglav is one great big huge hunk of dolomite.  No trees, plants, soil, or even boulders are to be found on the peak's slopes--just expanses of glistening white limestone.  The technical rock climbing on the peak is superb, and the \"trails\" are all very steep. Triglav is also the only major mountain in the world depicted on a national flag.  A stylized view of the mountain's three summits in a shield is in the center of the flag of Slovenia. The standard route on Triglav starts at a hut called Alyazhev Dom, reached at the end of a road from Mojstrana.  A heavily-used trail runs up the sheer sides of the dolomite, frequently using ladders, cables, and metal spikes drilled into the rock--although these aids make the ascent not difficult for confident hikers, those afraid of heights and exposure should stay back down at the giant carabiner sculpture near the hut. After the initial ascent the path winds about on a stark, rolling limestone landscape devoid of plants, talus, or soil.  After passing the Triglavski Dom high mountain hut, the path climbs up with the help of more ladders and cables over a false summit and on to the very top.  When I was there the summit was a zoo--enterprising vendors had hauled up ice-chests full of cold soda and beer, there was a line for the outhouse, and you could even get a special stamp on a document of your choice attesting to your accomplishment. There are many other more difficult routes on the mountain, including many that attack the sheer face that overlooks the Alyazhev Dom.  For a taste of adventure, one might try ascending the Plemence ridge from the col to the west of the summit--it's very steep and difficult, and the cables on the route are frayed and look like they haven't seen maintenance since the time of Tito, but strong climbers should find the exposure exhilalarating.  Other hikers may enjoy strolling around the extensive and bizarre dolomite moonscape in the vicinity of the summit instead.",

The current governmental topographic maps appear to support these elevations and the boundary location. However, there remains a possibility that a new survey may change this ranking again.

    "description":"Mount Kosciuszko (nicknamed \"Kozzy\" by the notoriously informal Ozzies) is the highest mountain on the flattest and smallest continent.  A thoroughly uninspiring peak, Kosciuszko gets a lot of abuse, particularly from those who claim that the Australia\/Oceania continent's rightful contribution to the \"Seven Summits\" is Puncak Jaya on New Guinea. Actually, Australia does have some interesting mountainous terrain, including the escarpament areas of the Blue Mountains, the crags of Tasmania, and even Mount Townshend , a craggier peak about 1 km north of Kosciuszko and the second highest of the continent.  If any one of these places held Australia's apex, people might not object to the low elevation of the continent high point.  Unfortuantely, though, Australia is stuck with Mt. Kosciuszko, a laughably easy dome with a auto-passable road right to the summit. However, cars are not allowed on the road past the Charlotte's Pass area, so gaining the summit involves a very easy hike of about an hour or so, depending on your fitness.  Elevation gain is minimal, and the wide-open terrain is scenic.  You can also hike to the summit from the Thredbo ski area to the south, another pretty easy stroll.  In the winter, there can be deep snow in the area. The peak was named in 1840 by Polish-Australian explorer Paul Strzelecki for Tadeusz Kosciuszko (1746-1817), the Polish military hero who fought in both the American and Polish wars of independence.  To Strzelecki, the peak resembled the tomb of Kosciuszko in Krakow, Poland.  Some think he had climbed Mount Townshend and thought it was the highest. There is some recent controversy over the spelling of this peak.  Until the late 1990s, it was spelled Kosciusko, the long-standing English-language spelling of the Polish patriot's name.  However, there has been a movement lately to add the extra \"z\" to his name to more accurately reflect the Polish spelling, not just in Australia, but in the USA as well (for example, the \"Thaddeus Kosciuszko National Memorial\" in Philadelphia).  Note that a true rendition of the Polish name would have an acute accent over the first \"s\".  And he was born Tadevush Kastsyushka in Belarus, and a true rendition of that name would, I believe, require the Cyrillic alphabet. An editorial: Even though the governments in Australia are firmly behind the new spelling, to me it seems kind of silly.  Like speakers of any other language, English speakers should have the right to make subtle changes to proper names to fit their linguistic and orthographic conventions.  In English, the capital of Poland is Warsaw, not Warszawa; the explorer is named Columbus, not Colombo or Colón.  I personally don't see much need to add a \"z\" to Koscuiszko's name, since it will have no effect on the usual English pronounciation.

    "description":"On September 3, 2019, scientists at Stockholm University measured the summits of Kebnekaise and determined that the highest rock of North Peak (Nordtoppen) was a meter higher than the melting snowcap of the South Peak (Sydtoppen).  Since the permanent snow and ice of the Sydtoppen is likely to remain lower as the Earth's climate warms, the Nordtoppen is now the highest point in Sweden and an peak with over 1500 meters of prominence. Climbers who attained the Nordtoppen summit at any time now have credit on this web site for the current Sweden high point and ultra-prominent peak.  Climbers who only climbed the Sydtoppen have credit for a ultra-prominent peak for their lifetime totals, but not the peak that now appears on most lists on Peakbagger.com.  There are a few historic lists that include the old pre-melting Sydtoppen.",
